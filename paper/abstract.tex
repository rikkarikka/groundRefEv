This paper provides a method for automatically solving algebra word problems by learn ing operations between quantities from Minimal Recursion Semantics. The domain-independent semantic representation is acted upon by a general learning method which makes less use of the specifics of the math domain than previous semantic solutions. We compare favorably against a state-of-the-art semantics-based method for solving word problems.
