Irwin's family went on a camping trip in the mountains.
On the first day, they hiked from their car to the campsite.
First, they hiked 0.2 of a mile from the car to a stream, and 0.4 of a mile from the stream to a meadow.
Then they hiked 0.1 of a mile from the meadow to the campsite.
How many miles did Irwin's family hike in all?
