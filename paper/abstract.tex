This paper provides a method for automatically solving algebra word problems by learning operations between quantities from Minimal Recursion Semantics. 
The domain-independent semantic representation is acted upon by a general learning method which reduces the reliance on domain-specific features compared to previous semantic-based systems. 
We compare favorably against a state-of-the-art semantics-based method for solving word problems, recording a 3.0\% absolute improvement in operator prediction.
